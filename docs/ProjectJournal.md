# Project Journal and Miscellaneous Notes

## Entry Date: September 18, 2024

I setup the backend config with a db.ts and pulled that into the server.ts for
the backend. I completed setting up the server.ts. I need to add routes to the
server.ts as they are completed.

I have files setup for API routes, and started setting up the blogRoutes. I
setup the blog model. I need to complete the models and controllers for the
backend and finish the API routes. I need to compile tests for the models,
controllers, and routes.

I will add documentation as I complete teach tasks and phase of the project. I
also plan to add these tasks (issues) to a Notion project board. I will mostly
copy all documentation into a Notion Wiki as well for future reference.
